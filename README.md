# Classification and Detection of Bearing Faults based on Vibration Signals using Transformers and Tsetlin Machines

This repository contains the code and documentation for a bachelor thesis focusing on the enhancement of bearing fault detection and classification systems using two machine learning models: the transformer, and the Tsetlin Machine (TM).

## These are the steps to train the models and generate results:
