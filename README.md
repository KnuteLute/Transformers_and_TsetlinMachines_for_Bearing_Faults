# Classification and Detection of Bearing Faults based on Vibration Signals using Transformers and Tsetlin Machines

This repository contains the code and documentation for a bachelor thesis focusing on the enhancement of bearing fault detection systems using machine learning models. Conventional manual diagnostics for detecting bearing failures in industrial machinery are becoming outdated, leading to potential financial impacts due to inaccuracies and late detections. This thesis investigates the performance of two advanced machine learning models, the transformer, and the less explored Tsetlin Machine (TM), in improving fault detection accuracy.

The TM offers interpretable machine learning capabilities, which have not been extensively studied or applied to signal analysis tasks. This research aims to bridge this gap by evaluating the effectiveness of TM alongside the transformer model. The primary objectives of the thesis are twofold:

##1. Classification of Bearing Faults: Investigating the ability of machine learning models to classify different types of bearing faults present in vibrational data.

##2. Fault Detection: Developing a binary classification system to detect whether a bearing is faulty or not, based on the analysis of vibration signals.

The repository includes implementation code, datasets, experimental results, and documentation detailing the methodology and findings of the research. By sharing this work, we aim to contribute to the advancement of fault detection systems in industrial machinery through the integration of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.
